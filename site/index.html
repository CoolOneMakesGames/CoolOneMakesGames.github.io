<h1>Me!</h1>


<p>Hello! my parents won't let me post my name on the internet
so call me by my usename, CoolOne!</p>

<p>The first version of my username was <b>CoolOne2321</b> in 2021.
It was for my minecraft, and later my Roblox and Among us account!</p>

<p style="color:blue;">In 2024, I started posting animations to scratch.
Here is my first one!</p>

<p>Later that same year, I made a youtube channel with that username
 from my dad's old account,here is an inbed of my first video!</p>

<p style="color:blue;">If that doesn't work just watch it on youtube

<em>(sorry its slightly off) Thats my banner! at least it was my banner in 2025-early 2026 if I forget to update.</em>

<p>In 2025 I was allowed to show my face, this is my first video with my face (I guess.)</p>
